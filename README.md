# mind.set

#### A React Native application to help boost your mood

## Description

_mind.set is a platform where users are encouraged to get into a positive frame of mind by engaging with prompts / activities that require the user to recall and track their own good memories and life events, list positive traits about themselves, give themselves complements or words of encouragement, etc. Unlike a typical mental health tracking app, mind.set is all about giving the user encouragement throughout their day by letting them interact with their own self-generated positive content. There are no generic surveys that feed into charts and graphs reminding you how bad you felt last week compared to the week before. Everything is personalized because YOU are the one writing content for yourself. Ideally, the app can be used in one of two ways: A user will log on to create content when they are so inclined, or the user will log on to retrieve a complement, memory, positive trait, etc. when they need a quick boost. The app is meant to be used in short spurts, so there will be no endless scrolling. I want the user to be able to engage with the app in a couple of minutes or less and then get back to their actual lives._
